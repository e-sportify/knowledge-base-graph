- a [[format]] for [[autochess]] and [[battle royale]] games where multiple [[participant]]s all compete in multiple [[match]]es and in order to win, one has to:
	- each [[participant]] will receive an amount of point based on the result (rankings) of each [[match]]
	- they much reach a certain cap point (usually 18-20 in TFT) AND they have to win AFTER reaching that cap point
		- for example, in TFT there are 8 rankings in a match with the respective point (8pt to 1pt) and if a [[participant]] win 3 [[match]]es then the final points received for this participant is 24, AND they have won the game, so they **checkmate** the tournament
- special cases
	- for [[stage]]s with more than 1 prizes, the organizer can have cases where the 2nd and 3rd [[standing]]s are tie, and they need to have additional criteria or resort to a [[tiebreaker]]
