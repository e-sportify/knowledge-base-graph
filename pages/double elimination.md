- a [[format]] where 2 losses result in the elimination of a [[participant]]
- the [[bracket]] for this format involves 2 different sub-bracket:
	- winners' bracket (W) / championship bracket / upper bracket
	- losers' bracket (L) / elimination bracket / lower bracket
		- participants who have lost once in the W bracket will be moved to this bracket
- the L bracket usually starts after the first round of W bracket
- a seeded double elimination stage requires a rule:
	- **Opponents who already played each other should meet again at the latest possible**

- special cases:
	- the grand final round can be
		- single: only one match between the W bracket's winner and L bracket's winner
		- double: if the W bracket's winner lose, a second grand final will be generated to settle on the real winner of the tournament
	- skip first round:
		- a method of putting 50% the lower seeded participants directly in the L bracket
		- this means those 50% participants don't have a second chance
