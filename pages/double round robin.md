- a [[format]] where each participant meets every other participant exactly twice, once at home and once away (or in some contexts, simply twice without specifying home/away).
- general formula for number of rounds, given there are n participants:
	- if n is even, number of rounds is 2 x (n - 1),number of matches per round is n/2
	- if n is odd, number of rounds is 2 x n ,number of matches per round is (n-1)/2
- A double round robin tournament can be scheduled using the same methods as a single round robin, but each pair of participants is scheduled to meet twice.
- Scenario(LCK 2024 Summer)
- 10 teams participate
- match type is bo3
- top 6 teams move to playoffs
- top 2 teams receive a [[bye]] to the second round
- in the playoffs, the matches follow a double elimination format, ensuring teams have a second chance even if they lose once.
- tiebreaker rules
- if two teams have the same number of series won, ties will be broken by:
	- game differential
	- head to head record
- if there's only one tiebreaker, it will be played as best of three
- if there's more than one tiebreaker, they will be played as best of one
